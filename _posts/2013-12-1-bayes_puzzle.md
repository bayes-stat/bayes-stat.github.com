玛丽莲•沃斯•莎凡特（Marilyn vos Savant，1946年8月11日－）是截至目前（2013年）为止吉尼斯世界记录所认定拥有最高智商（IQ）的人类及女性。她于1946年出生于美国密苏里州的圣路易斯，在刚满10岁的1956年9月时初次接受史丹福-比奈智力测验，测得智商高达228。后来数十年间陆陆续续接受数次智力测试，测出的智商有167+、186、218、230等等。莎凡特从事文学创作，也编写剧本，并长期在《Parade》杂志开辟名为〈Ask Marilyn〉的专栏，专门回复读者各式各样的问题，从数学到人生都有。玛丽莲也是普罗米修斯社团（Prometheus Society）的成员之一，该社团以非高智商者不能加入而闻名。

The Monty Hall problem


![TOB](https://bayes-stat.github.com/images/131204.jpg)

Savant was asked the following question in her September 9, 1990 column:
Suppose you’re on a game show, and you’re given the choice of three doors. Behind one door is a car, behind the others, goats. You pick a door, say #1, and the host, who knows what’s behind the doors, opens another door, say #3, which has a goat. He says to you, “Do you want to pick door #2?” Is it to your advantage to switch your choice of doors?

                     —Craig F. Whitaker Columbia, Maryland,

This question is called the Monty Hall problem due to its resembling scenarios on the game show Let's Make a Deal; its answer existed before it was used in “Ask Marilyn”. She said the selection should be switched to door #2 because it has a 2/3 chance of success, while door #1 has just 1/3. To summarize, 2/3 of the time the opened door #3 will indicate the location of the door with the car (the door you had not picked and the one not opened by the host). Only 1/3 of the time will the opened door #3 mislead you into changing from the winning door to a losing door. These probabilities assume you change your choice each time door #3 is opened, and that the host always opens a door with a goat. This response provoked letters of thousands of readers, nearly all arguing doors #1 and #2 each have an equal chance of success. A follow-up column reaffirming her position served only to intensify the debate and soon became a feature article on the front page of The New York Times. Parade received around 10,000 letters from readers who thought her wrong. 

Under the “standard” version of the problem, the host always opens a losing door and offers a switch. In the standard version, Savant’s answer is correct. However, the statement of the problem as posed in her column is ambiguous. The answer depends on what strategy the host is following. If the host operates under a strategy of only offering a switch if the initial guess is correct, it would clearly be disadvantageous to accept the offer. If the host merely selects a door at random, the question is likewise very different from the standard version. Savant addressed these issues by writing the following in Parade Magazine, “the original answer defines certain conditions, the most significant of which is that the host always opens a losing door on purpose. Anything else is a different question.”

She expounded on her reasoning in a second follow-up and called on school teachers to show the problem to classes. In her final column on the problem, she gave the results of more than 1,000 school experiments. Nearly 100% found it pays to switch. Of the readers who wrote computer simulations of the problem, 97% reached the same conclusion. Most respondents now agree with her original solution, with half of the published letters declaring their authors had changed their minds.
